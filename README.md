### What we did








4/9/21

- Today we added all of the default files, images, and jsons. We did some very basic html format. we also just made a plan of what we were going to do with a wire frame

4/13/21 

- We made the landing page look some what decent with a nav and welcome blurb. We also made a template for the json to print it out too. We also put in more images and stuff aswell as gave the artist credit

4/14/21

- Jaxson made all the json look pretty in the card template we made, Reid changed colors and formatted the nav bar so letters didnt overlap. I put in filler text and images to make the page look not so empty, then immediatly removed it.

4/15/21

- Jaxson made the cards for the data look nicer
- There were also merging issues that took all of our time... -_- Reid

4/16/21

- I worked on making a cursor do absolutely nothing becasue I left the image full size. I also worked on the new buttons we put in after I removed the little welcome message.

4/19/21

- Jaxson cleaned up some of the code and added a background color to the body. I got rid of the buttons and just made the image a button, Reid is currently working on making the image/links sized better and im writing the read me file.
